I designed the dashboard as part of Longhorn Racing Electric. The dashboard is the driverâ€™s main interface with the car. The dashboard is controlled by a TM4C123GH6PMI microcontroller, which is programmable via a dedicated JTAG port. It reads analog pedal data, converts it to digital through a MUX/ADC circuit, and the microcontroller reads the digital values. The board contains a CAN transceiver circuit, which it uses to communicate with the rest of the car. After reading the digital pedal values, the microcontroller sends them to the Rear CPU via CAN bus. The board also contains a differential I2C transceiver, providing the ability to communicate with sensors in the front of the car. The dashboard also contains 26 RGB LEDs, 2 seven-segment displays, and an LCD screen to provide necessary information to the driver about the state of the car. The dashboard is robustly designed, with two voltage regulators on its power supply, and a reverse polarity protection circuit.
